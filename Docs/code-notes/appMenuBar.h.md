# appMenuBar.h notes

The longer comments from `appMenuBar.h`, moved here 2026-09-12 so the code reads cleanly. The code points at each as `// notes §k`. Verbatim and in file order; each is titled by what it documents.

## 1. `gAppMenuBar`

SynthEdit's own File/Device/Controls/Layouts/Backup/Restore row, replacing the native Cocoa menu
bar (misc.mm) with SynthLib's cross-platform menuBar engine. gAppMenuBar is a NULL-label-
terminated tMenuBarItem[] suitable for passing straight into render_menu_bar()/
handle_menu_bar_click()/update_menu_bar_hover(); app_menu_bar_rect() is the bar's screen
rectangle for this frame.
